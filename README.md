# Pokédex

## Resume
Pokédex is an APP where you can consult basic information about pokémons.

### tools used:
- Nextjs (react)
- Sass (css preprocessor)
- Axios and Swr
- pokedex-promise-v2 (API pokeapi: https://pokeapi.co/ )

## Why did i choose to do this project?
I wanted to practice frontend skills and new tools like nextjs and sass. So i choose to build an Pokédex App because its colorfull, it's one of my favorite games, and when i played i always needed to know the pokémon data to choose my stategy or to know how to evolve it.

### Hope you like it the way i do ;)
